# To-DO-List-Reminders
This will be for my Do List / Reminder Project

A GUI that when active will either be a) primary panel with a Text Area with a reminder or task, a Text Area for the deadline in either hours & minutes or actual time. It will have two buttons one on each side: a check mark and "x". If the checkmark is clicked, it will signified that the task or reminder is complete and be highlighted green. If the "x" button is clicked, it will delete the task or reminder. There will be two buttons on the bottom: a "+" plus sign and a big red "X". The plus sign will create a new task/reminder. The big red "X" will delete all tasks. 

More Gizmos and whistles will be added later and place into the ReadMe file
